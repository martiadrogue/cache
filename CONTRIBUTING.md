# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github][link-project-home].


## Pull Requests

-   **[PSR-2 Coding Standard][link-psr2]** - The easiest way to apply the
    conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer][phpcs].

-   **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

-   **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any
    other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

-   **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow
    [SemVer v2.0.0][link-semver]. Randomly breaking public APIs is not an
    option.

-   **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

-   **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing,
    send multiple pull requests.

-   **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull
    request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits
    while developing, please [squash them][link-git-scm-commits] before
    submitting.

## Running Tests

``` bash
composer test
```

**Happy coding**!
